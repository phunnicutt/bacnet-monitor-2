Simple Authentication Module (`simple_auth.py`)\n- **SimpleAuth Class**: Basic authentication manager with API key and session support\n- **Environment Configuration**: Configurable via AUTH_ENABLED, AUTH_SESSION_TIMEOUT, AUTH_SHOW_TEST_CREDS\n- **Dual Storage**: Memory-based (for testing) with Redis fallback for production\n- **Default API Keys**: test_key_123 (read/write) and admin_key_456 (admin)\n- **Permission System**: read, write, admin permissions with role-based access\n\n### 2. Authentication Decorators\n- **@require_auth(permission)**: Protects API endpoints with permission checking\n- **@require_admin()**: Requires admin permission for sensitive operations\n- **@login_required**: Protects web pages requiring user session\n- **Flexible Authentication**: Supports both API keys (X-API-Key header) and session cookies\n\n### 3. Web Authentication Interface\n- **Login Template** (`template/login.tpl`): Professional login form matching BACmon design\n- **Test Credentials Display**: Shows test users and API keys in development mode\n- **Session Management**: Secure cookie-based sessions with timeout\n- **Login/Logout Routes**: Complete web authentication workflow\n\n### 4. System Integration\n- **BACmonWSGI Integration**: Added auth imports, login/logout/auth-info routes\n- **API Protection**: All major API endpoints now require 'read' permission\n- **Admin Protection**: Info, flush, and auth endpoints require 'admin' permission\n- **Template Context**: Authentication status included in navigation (login/logout links)\n\n### 5. Testing Infrastructure\n- **Test Script** (`test_simple_auth.py`): Comprehensive authentication testing\n- **Configuration Example** (`auth_config_example.txt`): Setup instructions and examples\n- **Multiple Auth Methods**: Tests API keys, web sessions, admin access, invalid credentials\n\n## Ready-to-Use Test Credentials\n\n### Web Login:\n- **test:test123** (read/write access)\n- **admin:admin123** (full admin access)\n- **readonly:readonly123** (read-only access)\n\n### API Keys:\n- **X-API-Key: test_key_123** (read/write permissions)\n- **X-API-Key: admin_key_456** (admin permissions)\n\n## Quick Testing Setup:\n1. Start BACmon server\n2. Visit http://localhost:8080/login for web access\n3. Use curl with API keys: `curl -H \"X-API-Key: test_key_123\" http://localhost:8080/api/status`\n4. Run `python test_simple_auth.py` for automated testing\n5. Visit /auth/info for authentication status and available keys\n\n## Security Features:\n- Session timeout (1 hour default)\n- Secure session tokens (32-byte URL-safe)\n- HTTP-only cookies\n- Permission-based access control\n- Authentication bypass option (AUTH_ENABLED=false)\n- Input validation and error handling\n\nThis implementation provides sufficient security for testing while being simple to configure and use. Perfect for development and demonstration purposes without the complexity of full enterprise authentication systems.\n</info added on 2025-05-30T22:11:43.806Z>",
