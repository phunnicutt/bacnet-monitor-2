# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Configurable Rate Thresholds [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add configuration options for rate monitoring thresholds in BACmon.ini
### Details:
Currently, rate thresholds are hardcoded in the source (e.g., SampleRateTask("total:s", 1, 20, 30)). Enhance the system to allow configurable thresholds in BACmon.ini. Add appropriate validation for these thresholds in config_validator.py. Update the SampleRateTask initialization to use these configuration values. This will allow administrators to adjust rate thresholds based on their network's characteristics without code changes.
<info added on 2025-05-30T21:00:46.797Z>
Implemented configurable rate thresholds in BACmon with the following updates:
1. Added a new [RateMonitoring] section to BACmon.ini and BACmon.ini.example with configurable threshold parameters including key, interval, max_value, and duration. Also added scan_interval configuration to control the frequency of rate checks.
2. Updated config_validator.py with new validators: RateThresholdValidator for rate threshold configurations and ScanIntervalValidator for scan interval. Enhanced create_bacmon_validator() to include validation for the new section.
3. Modified BACmon.py to read rate monitoring settings from the configuration file, dynamically create SampleRateTask instances based on the config, and maintain backward compatibility with default values.
4. Added tests in test_config_validator.py to verify the correct functioning of the validation.
5. Created documentation in docs/source/rate_monitoring.md to explain the new feature.
This implementation allows administrators to configure multiple rate monitoring thresholds with varied parameters, offering flexibility to monitor different traffic types and adapt to diverse network conditions without source code modifications.

## 2. Enhance Anomaly Detection Algorithm [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Improve rate monitoring by implementing more sophisticated anomaly detection
### Details:
The current system has a basic threshold-based detection that only triggers when values exceed a fixed limit for a certain duration. Enhance this with a more sophisticated algorithm that can:
1. Detect sudden spikes (even if below absolute threshold)
2. Identify unusual patterns based on historical data
3. Consider time-of-day variations (baseline normal traffic patterns)
4. Use statistical methods like moving averages, standard deviation, or DBSCAN clustering for anomaly detection
5. Implement adaptive thresholds that adjust based on historical patterns

Create a new module called anomaly_detection.py to implement these algorithms while maintaining backward compatibility.
<info added on 2025-05-30T21:05:58.475Z>
Implemented the enhanced anomaly detection algorithm with the following components:

1. New `anomaly_detection.py` module featuring:
   - Base `AnomalyDetector` class for extensible detection
   - `ThresholdDetector` for enhanced threshold and spike detection
   - `StatisticalDetector` using z-scores for anomaly identification
   - `TimeAwareDetector` for time-based pattern anomalies
   - `TrendDetector` for detecting unusual trends

2. `AnomalyDetectionManager` class to integrate multiple detection methods:
   - Weighted scoring for different detection approaches
   - Confidence scores for anomalies
   - Categorization of anomalies (spike, threshold, statistical, trend)
   - Historical anomaly tracking

3. `EnhancedRateTask` as a drop-in replacement for `SampleRateTask`:
   - Maintains original interface for backward compatibility
   - Integrates new anomaly detection algorithms
   - Consistent Redis operations

4. Updates to `BACmon.py`:
   - Conditional import of anomaly detection module
   - Configuration options for enhanced detection
   - Task creation based on configuration

5. Updates to `BACmon.ini.example`:
   - New configuration options for enhanced detection
   - Parameters for tuning detection sensitivity
   - Documentation of available options

6. Updates to `config_validator.py`:
   - Validation for new configuration parameters
   - Checks for parameter ranges and relationships
   - Validation of detection sensitivity options

7. Added corresponding tests in `test_config_validator.py` to verify validation functionality

This implementation significantly improves anomaly detection capabilities beyond simple thresholds, capturing gradual trends, time-based anomalies, and statistical outliers while ensuring compatibility with the existing system.

## 3. Improve Rate Monitoring Visualization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance the web interface for better visualization of rate monitoring data
### Details:
The current TrendDivs function in BACmonWSGI.py provides basic visualization of rate data. Improve this by:
1. Adding interactive charts with zoom/pan capabilities
2. Implementing heat maps to visualize traffic patterns over time
3. Creating comparative views (e.g., today vs. yesterday, this week vs. last week)
4. Adding visual indicators for anomalies and threshold violations
5. Implementing exportable reports for historical analysis
6. Including real-time updates for live monitoring

Update the relevant web interface components and add necessary JavaScript libraries (like Chart.js or D3.js) to support these enhanced visualizations.

## 4. Implement Rate-Based Alerting System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a flexible alerting system for rate monitoring events
### Details:
The current system stores critical messages in Redis but lacks a comprehensive alerting mechanism. Implement a flexible alerting system that:
1. Supports multiple notification channels (email, SMS, webhooks, etc.)
2. Allows configurable alert severity levels based on threshold violations
3. Provides rate-limiting for alerts to prevent notification storms
4. Includes alert acknowledgment and resolution tracking
5. Supports alert templates with variable substitution
6. Allows for scheduled maintenance windows with suppressed alerting

Create a new module called alert_manager.py to handle these capabilities and integrate it with the existing SampleRateTask system.

## 5. Extend Rate Monitoring to Additional Metrics [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add monitoring for additional metrics beyond simple packet counts
### Details:
Currently, the system primarily monitors packet counts. Extend rate monitoring to track and analyze:
1. Packet sizes (average, minimum, maximum)
2. Protocol distributions (percentage of different protocols over time)
3. Error rates (ratio of error packets to total traffic)
4. Response times (for relevant protocol exchanges)
5. Connection patterns (new connections per second, connection durations)
6. Service-specific metrics based on packet content analysis

Modify the CountInterval and SampleRateTask classes to support these additional metrics and update the Redis storage schema accordingly.

## 6. Optimize Redis Storage for Rate Data [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Improve Redis storage efficiency and performance for rate monitoring data
### Details:
The current implementation stores rate data in Redis using basic lists and string operations. Optimize this by:
1. Implementing data compression for historical time series data
2. Using Redis time series module (RedisTS) if available for more efficient storage
3. Implementing automatic data aggregation for older data points
4. Adding configurable retention policies for different time granularities
5. Optimizing Redis queries to reduce memory usage and improve performance
6. Adding database sharding capabilities for high-volume deployments

Update the relevant Redis operations in BACmon.py and redis_client.py to implement these optimizations while maintaining backward compatibility.

Starting implementation of Redis storage optimization for BACmon rate data.

Current Analysis:
1. Storage Pattern: BACmon currently uses Redis lists (lpush/ltrim/lrange) for time-series data
2. Data Retention: Fixed retention (maxLen parameter) with typical values around 1000 entries
3. Storage Keys: Multiple keys like "total:s", "ip:s", plus alarm history keys
4. Data Format: String serialization of Python lists [timestamp, value]
5. Query Patterns: Range queries (lrange 0, -1 or 0, 1000) for visualization and analysis

Optimization Plan:
1. Data Compression: Implement compression for historical data using zlib/gzip
2. Retention Policies: Add configurable retention with automatic aggregation
3. Time-Series Optimized Storage: Implement more efficient time-series storage patterns
4. Memory Management: Add memory usage monitoring and optimization
5. Batch Operations: Optimize Redis operations for better performance
6. Backward Compatibility: Ensure existing functionality continues to work

Starting with Redis optimization infrastructure.
