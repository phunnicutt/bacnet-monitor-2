# Task ID: 15
# Title: Create Basic Web Dashboard
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a stunning and comprehensive web dashboard for BACmon presentation, showcasing real-time monitoring data with professional design and interactive features.
# Details:
Implement a beautiful main dashboard for BACmon with a modern dark theme, real-time data visualization, and responsive design. The dashboard should serve as a presentation-quality interface to impress stakeholders with a comprehensive view of network monitoring data. Key components include:
- **Visual Design**: Dark theme with blue/cyan accents, glassmorphism effects, gradient cards, and smooth animations.
- **Dashboard Template**: Professional header, quick stats cards, real-time charts, system health monitoring, and quick action panels.
- **JavaScript Controller**: Advanced data integration, Chart.js visualizations, auto-refresh systems, and performance optimizations.
- **System Integration**: Route setup, authentication context, navigation updates, and welcome page enhancements.
- **Advanced Features**: Live monitoring, beautiful visualizations, smart data processing, responsive UX, and accessibility support.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Visual Design Testing**: Verify CSS styling for dark theme, responsiveness across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile), accessibility features (focus states, reduced motion), and animation smoothness.
2. **Template Functionality**: Test rendering of all dashboard components (header, stats cards, charts, health status, activity lists) for correct data display and layout consistency.
3. **JavaScript Controller**: Validate real-time data updates via API endpoints, Chart.js integration for accurate chart rendering, auto-refresh intervals (30s for status, 5m for full refresh), and interactive features (time range selection, manual refresh, keyboard shortcuts).
4. **System Integration**: Confirm /dashboard route functionality, authentication context display, navigation link accuracy, and welcome page CTA visibility.
5. **User Experience**: Test loading states, error handling, empty state management, and overall performance for smooth interactions.
6. **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and focus management meet WCAG standards.
