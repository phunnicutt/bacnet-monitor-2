# Task ID: 6
# Title: Address Changed Module Imports
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update imports for modules like the Redis client to ensure compatibility with Python 3. All module imports have been successfully updated for Python 3 compatibility, with compatibility layers removed.
# Details:
The task has been completed with the following changes implemented:
- Updated BACmonWSGI.py to replace Python 2/3 compatibility HTTP imports with Python 3 only imports.
- Changed from try/except ImportError blocks to direct Python 3 imports.
- Updated to use http.server as BaseHTTPServer.
- Updated to use http.client.responses as http_responses.
- Updated to use urllib.parse for parse_qs and urlencode.
Affected files:
- BACmonWSGI.py (lines 18-22): Updated HTTP-related imports.

# Test Strategy:
Verification has been completed:
- All Python 2/3 compatibility import blocks have been replaced with Python 3 native imports.
- HTTP module imports now use the correct Python 3 module paths.
- No remaining import compatibility issues found in the codebase.
