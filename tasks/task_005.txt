# Task ID: 5
# Title: Update String Handling for Bytes vs. Str Compatibility
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure that string handling is compatible with both bytes and str types in Python 3. The task has been completed with specific fixes for Redis type comparisons.
# Details:
The codebase already had robust patterns for handling bytes and str compatibility. The primary issue was with Redis type() method returning strings in Python 3 instead of bytes, which has been addressed with targeted fixes in BACmonWSGI.py. Changes include updating comparisons from b'none' to 'none' at specific lines for compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
Verification has been completed to ensure proper string/bytes handling across the codebase. Testing included:
- Reviewing existing patterns for string/bytes compatibility.
- Confirming correct usage of isinstance(data, bytes) checks.
- Verifying proper application of decode('utf-8') where necessary.
- Ensuring binary protocol data (BACnet packets) uses byte strings correctly.
- Validating Redis data handling converts bytes to strings appropriately.
All changes have been tested and confirmed to work as expected.
