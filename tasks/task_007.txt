# Task ID: 7
# Title: Update Docker Configuration for Python 3
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify Docker configuration to support Python 3 runtime environment. The configuration has been successfully updated and validated for Python 3 compatibility.
# Details:
The Docker configuration for Python 3 has been completed with the following achievements:
- Docker configuration analyzed and confirmed to be well-configured for Python 3.9.
- Comprehensive testing conducted with a dedicated test script (test_docker_python3.sh) including 6 test phases.
- Python 3.9.2 installation validated along with compatibility of required packages (redis, bacpypes3, bottle, simplejson, lxml).
- BACmon Python files compile successfully with Python 3.
- Redis server and Python 3 client integration verified.
- Core modules (timeutil, bacpypes_compat) import successfully.

Docker Configuration Features:
- Base Image: Debian 11 Slim (modern, secure, lightweight)
- Python Version: 3.9.2 (fully compatible with BACmon features)
- Package Management: pip3 with proper dependency resolution
- Redis Integration: Embedded Redis server with optimized configuration
- Security: Non-root bacmon user with proper file permissions
- Health Checks: Built-in Redis health monitoring
- Port Configuration: BACnet (47808/UDP) and Redis (6379/TCP) ports exposed
- Volume Management: Persistent log storage with Docker volumes

Deliverables:
- Enhanced test_docker.sh with improved port conflict handling
- New test_docker_python3.sh for comprehensive Python 3 testing
- Validated production-ready Docker setup

# Test Strategy:
Testing has been completed using the test_docker_python3.sh script, which includes 6 comprehensive test phases to validate Python 3 compatibility, package functionality, code compilation, and Redis integration. The configuration is confirmed to be production-ready through these tests.
