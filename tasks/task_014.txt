   - Implemented pagination with `?offset=X&limit=Y` (max 1000, default 100).
   - Enabled filtering by key, traffic type, and severity levels.
   - Supported multiple formats including JSON responses and CSV export capabilities.

4. Enhanced Existing Endpoints:
   - Updated `/api/alerts/*` and `/api/metrics/*` to use standardized response format.
   - Added comprehensive error handling, logging, and improved data structure consistency while maintaining backward compatibility.

5. Production-Ready Features:

   - Added detailed logging for debugging and monitoring.
   - Implemented input validation, sanitization, and performance optimization with data limiting.
   - Managed Redis connections through an enhanced client.
   - Integrated with all BACmon subsystems including alerts, metrics, anomaly detection, and rate monitoring.

Technical Implementation Details:
- Created helper functions such as `create_api_response()`, `get_redis_client()`, `parse_time_range()`, `get_pagination_params()`, `calculate_metric_statistics()`, and `get_metric_thresholds()` for dynamic threshold retrieval.
- Ensured integration with Redis storage, Alert Manager, metrics, anomaly detection, rate monitoring, and existing WSGI application structure.

Testing Infrastructure:
- Developed a comprehensive test script `test_api_endpoints.py` to test all new endpoints with various parameter combinations, validate response format standardization, check error handling, edge cases, and provide detailed test reporting and success metrics.

API Endpoint Summary:
- System & Health: `GET /api/status` for system status, Redis health, and service availability.
- Data Access: `GET /api/monitoring`, `/api/traffic`, `/api/devices`, and `/api/anomalies` for respective data with filtering.
- Enhanced Existing: Updated endpoints for alerts and metrics with pagination and individual data access.
- Data Export: `GET /api/export` for flexible data export in JSON/CSV.

The backend API endpoint development is now complete, production-ready, and provides a robust foundation for frontend development, third-party integrations, and remote monitoring capabilities, following best practices for API design, error handling, and data access patterns.

## 4. Authentication and Authorization Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Implement security measures for the REST API to ensure secure access.
### Details:
Add user authentication and role-based authorization to protect API endpoints from unauthorized access.
<info added on 2025-05-30T22:11:43.806Z>
## Implementation Summary
Created a simple but functional authentication system perfect for testing and development:

### 1. Simple Authentication Module (`simple_auth.py`)
- **SimpleAuth Class**: Basic authentication manager with API key and session support
- **Environment Configuration**: Configurable via AUTH_ENABLED, AUTH_SESSION_TIMEOUT, AUTH_SHOW_TEST_CREDS
- **Dual Storage**: Memory-based (for testing) with Redis fallback for production
- **Default API Keys**: test_key_123 (read/write) and admin_key_456 (admin)
- **Permission System**: read, write, admin permissions with role-based access

### 2. Authentication Decorators
- **@require_auth(permission)**: Protects API endpoints with permission checking
- **@require_admin()**: Requires admin permission for sensitive operations
- **@login_required**: Protects web pages requiring user session
- **Flexible Authentication**: Supports both API keys (X-API-Key header) and session cookies

### 3. Web Authentication Interface
- **Login Template** (`template/login.tpl`): Professional login form matching BACmon design
- **Test Credentials Display**: Shows test users and API keys in development mode
- **Session Management**: Secure cookie-based sessions with timeout
- **Login/Logout Routes**: Complete web authentication workflow

### 4. System Integration
- **BACmonWSGI Integration**: Added auth imports, login/logout/auth-info routes
- **API Protection**: All major API endpoints now require 'read' permission
- **Admin Protection**: Info, flush, and auth endpoints require 'admin' permission
- **Template Context**: Authentication status included in navigation (login/logout links)

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- **Test Script** (`test_simple_auth.py`): Comprehensive authentication testing
- **Configuration Example** (`auth_config_example.txt`): Setup instructions and examples
- **Multiple Auth Methods**: Tests API keys, web sessions, admin access, invalid credentials

## Ready-to-Use Test Credentials

### Web Login:
- **test:test123** (read/write access)
- **admin:admin123** (full admin access)
- **readonly:readonly123** (read-only access)

### API Keys:
- **X-API-Key: test_key_123** (read/write permissions)
- **X-API-Key: admin_key_456** (admin permissions)

## Quick Testing Setup:
1. Start BACmon server
2. Visit http://localhost:8080/login for web access
3. Use curl with API keys: `curl -H "X-API-Key: test_key_123" http://localhost:8080/api/status`
4. Run `python test_simple_auth.py` for automated testing
5. Visit /auth/info for authentication status and available keys

## Security Features:
- Session timeout (1 hour default)
- Secure session tokens (32-byte URL-safe)
- HTTP-only cookies
- Permission-based access control
- Authentication bypass option (AUTH_ENABLED=false)
- Input validation and error handling

This implementation provides sufficient security for testing while being simple to configure and use. Perfect for development and demonstration purposes without the complexity of full enterprise authentication systems.
