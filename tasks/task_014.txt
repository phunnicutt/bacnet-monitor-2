## 4. Authentication and Authorization Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Implement security measures for the REST API to ensure secure access.
### Details:
Add user authentication and role-based authorization to protect API endpoints from unauthorized access.
<info added on 2025-05-30T22:11:43.806Z>
## Implementation Summary
Created a simple but functional authentication system perfect for testing and development:

### 1. Simple Authentication Module (`simple_auth.py`)
- **SimpleAuth Class**: Basic authentication manager with API key and session support
- **Environment Configuration**: Configurable via AUTH_ENABLED, AUTH_SESSION_TIMEOUT, AUTH_SHOW_TEST_CREDS
- **Dual Storage**: Memory-based (for testing) with Redis fallback for production
- **Default API Keys**: test_key_123 (read/write) and admin_key_456 (admin)
- **Permission System**: read, write, admin permissions with role-based access

### 2. Authentication Decorators
- **@require_auth(permission)**: Protects API endpoints with permission checking
- **@require_admin()**: Requires admin permission for sensitive operations
- **@login_required**: Protects web pages requiring user session
- **Flexible Authentication**: Supports both API keys (X-API-Key header) and session cookies

### 3. Web Authentication Interface
- **Login Template** (`template/login.tpl`): Professional login form matching BACmon design
- **Test Credentials Display**: Shows test users and API keys in development mode
- **Session Management**: Secure cookie-based sessions with timeout
- **Login/Logout Routes**: Complete web authentication workflow

### 4. System Integration
- **BACmonWSGI Integration**: Added auth imports, login/logout/auth-info routes
- **API Protection**: All major API endpoints now require 'read' permission
- **Admin Protection**: Info, flush, and auth endpoints require 'admin' permission
- **Template Context**: Authentication status included in navigation (login/logout links)

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- **Test Script** (`test_simple_auth.py`): Comprehensive authentication testing
- **Configuration Example** (`auth_config_example.txt`): Setup instructions and examples
- **Multiple Auth Methods**: Tests API keys, web sessions, admin access, invalid credentials

## Ready-to-Use Test Credentials

### Web Login:
- **test:test123** (read/write access)
- **admin:admin123** (full admin access)
- **readonly:readonly123** (read-only access)

### API Keys:
- **X-API-Key: test_key_123** (read/write permissions)
- **X-API-Key: admin_key_456** (admin permissions)

## Quick Testing Setup:
1. Start BACmon server
2. Visit http://localhost:8080/login for web access
3. Use curl with API keys: `curl -H "X-API-Key: test_key_123" http://localhost:8080/api/status`
4. Run `python test_simple_auth.py` for automated testing
5. Visit /auth/info for authentication status and available keys

## Security Features:
- Session timeout (1 hour default)
- Secure session tokens (32-byte URL-safe)
- HTTP-only cookies
- Permission-based access control
- Authentication bypass option (AUTH_ENABLED=false)
- Input validation and error handling

This implementation provides sufficient security for testing while being simple to configure and use. Perfect for development and demonstration purposes without the complexity of full enterprise authentication systems.

## 5. Rate Limiting and API Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse and provide detailed API documentation for users.
### Details:
Implement rate limiting mechanisms and create comprehensive documentation for all API endpoints.

## 6. Consistent JSON Formats and Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Ensure all API responses follow a consistent JSON format and include proper error handling.
### Details:
Standardize response structures and implement error codes and messages for various failure scenarios.
<info added on 2025-05-30T22:46:31.148Z>
Analysis of the current JSON response format standardization reveals that all API endpoints are using the standardized `create_api_response()` function, ensuring consistent JSON format with status, timestamp, version, code, and data/error fields. Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes (404, 500, 400), detailed logging, and structured error messages is in place. However, improvements are needed in input validation for query parameters and request bodies, standardization of custom error codes, and addressing missing error scenarios. Non-API web dashboard endpoints return basic dict responses, but these are intended for web forms, not API consumption. Remaining work includes enhancing input validation, improving error code categorization, adding missing error scenarios, and documenting the response format standard.

<info added on 2025-05-30T22:49:31.499Z>
Implementation progress on JSON format standardization enhancements includes the following completed improvements:

1. Standardized Error Code System (`APIErrorCodes` class) with comprehensive categories for client errors (4001-4012) and server errors (5001-5005), structured for better API client handling across parameter validation, authentication, Redis connections, and system errors.
2. Enhanced input validation functions such as `validate_query_parameters()`, `validate_time_range_params()`, `validate_pagination_params()`, `validate_alert_level()`, and `safe_redis_operation()` for robust parameter and operation validation.
3. Enhanced `create_api_response()` function with an optional `error_code` parameter for structured error reporting while maintaining backward compatibility.
4. Updated API endpoints including `/api/alerts`, `/api/alerts/history`, `/api/alerts/<uuid>`, acknowledge/resolve, and `/api/extended_metrics` with comprehensive parameter validation, UUID format checks, pagination support, and specific error codes.

Technical improvements include better error categorization for client and server errors with actionable messages, input validation enhancements for parameter existence, type, value range, format, and cross-parameter checks, and an enhanced response format with structured error codes, additional metadata, and consistent timestamp/version information.

Validation status confirms all API endpoints use the standardized response format, comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes, enhanced input validation, structured error codes for programmatic handling, and context-specific Redis connection error messages. The JSON format standardization and error handling are now significantly enhanced, improving developer experience and debugging capabilities.
